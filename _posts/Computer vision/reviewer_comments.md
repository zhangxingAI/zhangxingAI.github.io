Reviewer #1: This is an interesting work on the effects of MICP treatment and grain size on the bio-cemented calcareous sand. The overall quality of this MS is good. The results and findings are instructive for the community. Some comments are listed below to improve the quality.

1. Line 72. The authors are suggested to introduce immersion method briefly here, since this is the first time it is mentioned.

2. Line 125. Please give the full name of CS when it is first used.

3. Section 2.2. The authors are suggested to clarify the usage of MICP treatment method, and the preprocessing treatment (immersion, mix, …) throughout the MS, to avoid readers' confusion.

4. Line 133. The authors are suggested to give the actual porosity of the specimens. It is important to analyze the results.

   0.5-1 94g 1-2 90g 0.1-0.5 96g

   $porosity = (3.14*1.8*1.8-94/2.65)/(3.14*1.8*1.8)$

5. Line 137-145. Are the amounts of BS in the specimens the same among the three methods? This might be a reason for the different performance.

   It is not the same, the immersion method need more BS to ensure that the sample can be total immersed in the liquid media, the mix method need less BS. Despite the amount of the BS are different, but the sample in the pre-treatment are saturate, so the BS adsorbed in surface of samples are appromax the same. Actually, immersion method and mix method will influence the BS adsorption of the sample, if we use the same BS in the mix method as in the immersion method, the sample was also over saturate.

6. Line 165. Is there quartz sand in this study?

   No, the test materials are all pure calcareous sand

7. Line 195-197. Use porosity to explain the results is confusing since grain size is a major concern herein. Do you mean the pore size?

   Actully it means both the pore size and pore numbers. the sample with bigger particle size will contains bigger 喉道 and less porosity, while the sample with smaller particle size will contains crowded and narrow 喉道. As the reviewer's opinion, using the porosity is complicated to explaim the results. But the main reason contributing to the influence of particle size is the porosity,  herein we are trying to find the reason in the difference of bio-cement content. 

8. The range of D60 is 0.33-1.6 and that of Cu is 1.45-2.43 for the actual experiments. The authors are suggested to be cautious to draw maps like Fig. 5 and to draw conclusion for Cu=1-4.

   Changed to Cu 1-3

9. Section 3.2. Pictures of the specimens after the loading would be helpful to identify the failure patterns.

10. Figure 7. The fitting line seems curly for the first row and linear for the second row. Why? Different mechanism?

11. Section 3.4. It is helpful to analyze the microstructure for better understanding of the underlying mechanism. Indeed, there are some recent works on this topic might be enlightening to the authors, e.g., "Particle Size Effect on Unconfined Compressive Strength of Biotreated Sand." Transportation Geotechnics, 101092. "3D DEM modeling of biocemented sand with fines as cementing agents." Int J Numer Anal Met, 47 (2): 212-240. A discussion is encouraged.



Reviewer #2: This study aimed to investigate the influence of grain size and treatment methods on the bio-improvement of calcareous sands. Two treatment methods, namely immersing and mixing methods, were put forward to cure the sand specimens with various grading. A series of laboratory tests were further conducted to evaluate treatment effect, and several empirical equations were obtained to predict the mechanical properties of the bio-cementing samples. Overall, this manuscript was well structured and written, and some interesting and valuable results were obtained. I just have some specific comments for the authors' consideration.
1.The mixing method for the MICP treatment is interesting, and seems to have a nice treatment effect. So, I am interested in the future perspective of this treatment in the field application. The authors are suggested to discuss the application prospect in the introduction.

we discussed the application the the section 4 conclusion, line 423- 428

2.line216: the equation (6) and equation are the same, please check.
3.Line 227: what are the z and z ̅ mean?
4.Line 231: indicating that the model is more capable of predicting the outcome modified to the model predicts outcomes more accurately?
5.Line 232: 'the fitting equations' should be 'the fitting equations.
6.Please adjust the figures if it is necessary to ensure that all figures could be distinguished in the binary color print mode.
7.Line 388: The sentence can be modified to 'the ammonia gas could not be entirely transported outside, resulting in the rest gas stay inside the specimens and formed air bubble.'
8.Line 261-265, did all the specimens show the same regularity of failure pattern? Please indicate the repeatability of the test results.
